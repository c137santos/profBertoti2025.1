Design Patterns discussed at FATEC college.

A design pattern is as pratical solution to a recurring (common) design problem in code. There are 23 design patterns identified in a famous book called Design Patterns, elements of reusable objetc oriented sofwate, written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides, also known as Gang of Four (GoF).

Design patterns help to create a design vocabulary. Rather than having to explain the details of a design solution over, and over again, you can simplify the discussion by having a suggestive word to describe it.

There are 3 different types of design patterns:

* creation patterns - when you need to create or cloning objects

* structural patterns - when you need to compose objects, in other words, when you need connected to objects with other. ANd how they classes interact with each other. Here we examined the major deisgn principles like Decomposition and Generalization, and how they are expressed in UML class diagrams with Association, Aggregation, Composition, Inheritance and interface relationships

* behavioral patterns - related about relationships, goals and responsibilities between objects.Behavioral Patterns also focus on how independent objects work together to achieve a common goal. They are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. With generalization, is more effectively reuse objects using inheritance.
